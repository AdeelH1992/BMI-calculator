            <p>The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator can be used to calculate your BMI value and weight status while
                taking
                your age into consideration.</p>
            <h2>Reference</h2>
            <p>Your BMI is a measurement of your body weight based on your height and weight. Although your BMI does not
                actually "measure" your percentage of body fat, it is a useful tool to estimate a healthy body weight
                based
                on your height. Due to its ease of measurement and calculation, it is the most widely used diagnostic
                indicator to identify a person's optimal weight depending on his height. Your BMI "number" will inform
                you
                if you are underweight, of normal weight, overweight, or obese. However, due to the wide variety of body
                types, the distribution of muscle and bone mass, etc., it is not appropriate to use this as the only or
                final indication for diagnosis.
